Changed the code to ensure that there was alt ref used next to the images. 
Added classes where they were missing 
Next I went to upload it onto github
Once starting a new repository I went to the terminal to commit the changes and push them onto git
I had problems when publishing the site the first time you were only able to see the README file, during office hours it was suggested that I take the index.html out of the assets folder.  When I did that you were able to see the HTML but now the CSS file is not responding and there are no images.
At this time I went in and rewrote the path within the code as that changed when I pulled the HTML out of the assets.
